5. **Icon Support**: Logout icon (FiLogOut) for visual clarity

### User-Specific Features:

- **Vendors**: Access to Profile Settings and Account Settings with vendor-specific features
- **Admins**: Access to System Settings and admin-specific controls

## User Experience Flow

### Desktop Experience:
1. User clicks on their avatar/name in the header
2. Dropdown menu appears with options including "Logout"
3. User clicks "Logout"
4. Toast notification confirms successful logout
5. User is redirected to appropriate login page

### Mobile Experience:
1. User opens mobile menu (hamburger icon)
2. Logout option is visible in mobile menu
3. Same logout flow as desktop

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context:
- Uses `useAuth()` hook from AuthContext
- Calls `logout()` function from authentication service
- Handles success/error states appropriately

### Navigation:
- Uses `useNavigate()` from React Router
- Proper cleanup of authentication state
- Redirects to appropriate pages based on user type

### UI Components:
- Chakra UI Menu components for consistent styling
- Icon integration with react-icons/fi
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Maintenance Notes

- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- Easy to maintain and update centrally through AuthContext

3. **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity
4. **Logout Analytics**: Track logout patterns for UX improvements
